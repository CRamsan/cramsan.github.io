I have spent the last several days working on a new release for Auraxis Control Center. My main focus for this release is to bring tablet support as well as to improve the documentation for the project.

Right now all the code is at the table_support branch. You can see the progress on this pictures: 

{% include post_image.html image_id=site.data.image_repo.images.CtkaqlK %}

Most of the functionality is there but there are still an unexpected behaviour with the action bar that I need to fix. I am planning on finishing this milestone before the end of the month but it will all depend on how my schedule will be.
