title: First time to the Seattle Retro Gaming Expo
---

On  Saturday July 23rd was the 2016 Seattle Retro Gaming Expo in the Seattle Center Exhibition Hall. I have been to the 
Portland Retro Gaming Expo a couple times and I know that SRGE was a smaller and more local event. Despite of the much smaller 
size and limited number of vendors, the prices I found were really good and the collection was diverse. As always, the people 
were very friendly and I got to talk to a few guys about technical stuff. I could not stay very long because I had to leave at 
around 3:00PM but this is what I ended leaving the expo with:

- Alone In The Dark(DreamCast)

I wanted to get another DreamCast game and Alone In The Dark is a game I have heard a lot about. I got it from the great guys at 
Game Over Videogames.

- Future Cop L.A.P.D

This game was one I really liked as a kid but I had completely forgotten its name. It happened to show up for very cheap so of course I had to get it.

- Gex 3 Deeo Cover Gecko

Gex 3 featuring Marliece Andrada, I think that is all the description that this game needs.

- Phantasy Star Online Episode III Card Revolution

I already happen to have this game but this game is complete with all manuals and a gase in great condition.

- Metroid Prime 2 Echoes

The sequel for the awesome Metroid Prime for GameCube. 

- Final Fantasy Chrystal Chronicles

When I first got my GameCube as a kid, I had the option to get either this game or Star Wars The Clone Wars. Since I wanted to 
play something with my brother we descided to get Star Wars, but now I will finally experience what I could have had.

In between buying stuff I also got the chance to meet a few people. The first one was Joe from [8Bit Heroes](https://www.thenew8bitheroes.com/)
, he described the project and the documentary that he and his team were working on. He also showed the tool they developed to 
work with NES hardware and limitations.

Then I had the chance to speak was Dan and Terry Diebold, the current owners of the Nintendo-PlayStation.

I chatted with both of them and they told me about about how they ended up with the console and what their plans are. 
It was great been able to see what could have been had the partnership between Nintendo and Sony worked out.

Overall, even though I didn't spend much time in this convention I had a great time. I will totally be attending next year.
