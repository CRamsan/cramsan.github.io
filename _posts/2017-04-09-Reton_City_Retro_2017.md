title: Reton City Retro 2017
---

I just got back from Renton City Retro in Renton, an small expo for vintage toys and video games. The event was on the smaller side but there was a great variety of vendor and with lots of people. My goal for this expo was to stick to my budget of $60, which I have to say, I did pretty well.

 - Parking: $2.1
 - Blue Dreamcast Controller + JPN Pokemon Stadium 3 CIB + Genesis Controller: $20
 - GBA Case: $2
 - GBC Case: $2
 - Wii(does not read disks): $5
 - Wiimote + Nunchuck: $4
 - GBA Gamebcube cable: $1
 - Traded in Vertical Force + PSO Ep3: +$15
 - JPN Smash 64 CIB(box is beat up): $30
 - Traded in Valkyria Chronicles+PS) Ep3: +$12

In total it all came to roughly $40 and I got a lot of little things I wanted.
