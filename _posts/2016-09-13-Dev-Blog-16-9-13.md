I finally got to show the prototype I have for BattleVR in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SfgSPAzYaM&feature=autoshare) as well as a 
Reddit [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/GearVR/comments/5291v2/prototype_of_the_space_fighter_game_i_am/). The reaction was overall positive with 
some discussion, which is always good. What I am showing is the milestone that I call [Prototype 3](https://github.com/CRamsan/BattleVR/milestone/1). The idea
with prototype 1-3 was for me to get familiar with Unity and to code the basic systems that would power the game. Basically a POC with most of the core components
of the game.

Now that the code and the word is out, my plan is to do weekly iterations along side with a blog post. I have also update the 
[Roadmap](https://github.com/CRamsan/BattleVR/wiki/Roadmap) and the [Milestones](https://github.com/CRamsan/BattleVR/milestones) page. 
Now the project is moving into [Alpha-1](https://github.com/CRamsan/BattleVR/milestone/2) stage.

### Changes

#### Added Support for LOD - e9c75d9f397bb5c42ec6bad7f874fc07ed7632ad
This is the first change after  moving into Alpha-1. It involves replacing the main meshes(player ships, capital ships, space station) with LOD(Level of Detail) Groups. 
This are basically an abstraction that allows me to provide different meshes of different complexity based on the distance of the camera. I added support for 
LOD groups in the PlayerPrefab and the respective AssetManager methods. Also some enviromental objects are using LOD Groups like Capital Ships and the SpaceStation 
in the middle of Level1.

That all for last week. Thanks for reading.
