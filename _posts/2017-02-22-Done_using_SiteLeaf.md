title: Done using SiteLeaf
---

Well that did not long. I tried using Siteleaf but I had to drop it pretty quickly. The problem was that my personal workflow did not connect well with Siteleaf, constant commits, issues with sign in and deployments and having to pay. At the end I just got back to hosting everything in AWS and manage it all  myself.

The workflow will now be:
 1. Edit on client
 2. Push changes to AWS central repo
 3. Deploy to test 
 4. Deploy to prod
 5. Push changes to github

Yay!
