I have not written an update for a few weeks but several bugs have been fixed and progress remains steady. I algo got to take this game to the VR Meetup in Seattle and it was a great time. The overall feedback was that people were excited to see a multiplayer game. But still the graphics and UI were very unimpressive. 

I remain focused on fixing remaining bugs and adding the needed assets to present this as a valid prototype game.
