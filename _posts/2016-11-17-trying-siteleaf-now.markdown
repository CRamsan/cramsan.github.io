Some quick point:
Good:
* Nice and responsive UI
* Options for hosting your repo
* Good pricing
The Bad:
* DONT FRICKING COMMIT ALL I DO
* Loves to commit and push changes all the time
* Did I mention that SiteLeaf like committing to the repo more than it should? Well, it does.

Stop it!! I will use your site but don't create commits and push them without asking me for permission.
