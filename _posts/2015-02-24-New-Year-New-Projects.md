Status Update
------------

The LibGDX tutorial I had in mind never really happened but I that does not mean I have not done anything with Libgdx.
I have been using it periodically to stay up-to-date but I dont have any plans in mind to use it for a game or app.

I also have been working with Alicia to get a Youtube channel. We just started and we are trying to get ideas on what to focus and how we should do things. The current plan is for her to have a Let'sPlay channel with some other personal anecdotes while I will be doing videos, mostly about Planetside 2.
