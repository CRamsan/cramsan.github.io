I am still working on integrating this blog with IFTT. The goal is that every time I post something here both my Twitter and Facebook page will be updated. 

So far the IFTTT<->Facebook integration is working fine but the integration with Twitter did not work. This post is also another test to see if it is working. My assuption is that the Twitter interation did not work because I accidentaly turned off the IFTTT recipe rather than trigerring it. As a result the post would not be considered "new" anymore.

If the Twitter recipe works, the next step will be to fix how I am handling images. Currently I am adding <div> and <a> tags around all the images. Instead I will move to use markdown syntax for all images and then the style will be applied with CSS.
