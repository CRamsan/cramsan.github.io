I am a developer who also likes breandancing and longboarding. I wish I could cook better but I will keep practicing so one day I will be able to give good homage to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_cuisine">Peruvian Cuisine</a>.

About what I do, I like using my programming skillz <--(did you notice the 'z', that means those are some sreious skills) to automate my daily life and to came up with new solutions to the problems I seea round me. Do you have a problem with rats or pests? Sorry I do not do that.

Thanks for reading :)
