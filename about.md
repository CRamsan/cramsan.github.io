I am a developer who also likes breakdancing and longboarding. I wish I could cook better but I will keep practicing so one day I will be able to give good homage to the [Peruvian Cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peruvian_cuisine).

About what I do, I like using my programming skills to automate my daily life and to came up with new solutions to the problems I see around me. 

Thanks for reading :)
